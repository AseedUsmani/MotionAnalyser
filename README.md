This application detects the activity you are doing (eg: Walking, running, driving); and saves data in a text file.
Detects when the user has parked his vehicle, at that time it saves the GPS location and pushes a notification to user asking for confirmation. At maximum, the application saves last 5 locations where parking was detected, and if user clicks on a marker on the map, Dialog box opens which asks the user whether they want to confirm this location where they parked their vehicle. If the user confirms, that location marker is saved while all the others are deleted, if the user denies then that location marker is deleted.
